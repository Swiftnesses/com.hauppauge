# Hauppauge Z-Wave devices

This app adds support for Hauppauge z-wave devices in Homey.

These devices are rebrands or derivatives or Philio devices (same manufacturer identifier). 
However, due to some subtle devices differences this app was created in order to maintain them separately.

Supported devices:
* Plug in switch
* 4 in 1 multisensor

Currently supported languages:
* English
